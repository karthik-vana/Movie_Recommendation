# 🎬 AI-Powered Movie Recommendation System | Machine Learning | Python

A robust **Movie Recommendation System** leveraging **Machine Learning** techniques like **Content-Based Filtering** and **Collaborative Filtering** implemented in **Python**. This project intelligently recommends movies tailored to user preferences using popular datasets such as TMDB and IMDB.

---

##  Features
-  Personalized movie suggestions based on user history and preferences  
-  Built with Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy for efficient ML pipeline  
-  Utilizes TMDB/IMDB movie metadata (genres, cast, crew, ratings)  
-  Interactive and user-friendly web app powered by Streamlit  
-  Model accuracy validated using cosine similarity & correlation metrics  

---

## 🧩 Technologies & Methods
- Data wrangling and preprocessing using Pandas & NumPy  
- TF-IDF vectorization for text-based movie features  
- Cosine similarity for finding similar movie vectors  
- User-based collaborative filtering for personalized recommendations  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Matplotlib & Seaborn visualization  

---

## 🎥 Dataset
- Sourced from **https://github.com/YBI-Foundation/Dataset/blob/main/Movies%20Recommendation.csv** on Ybi Foundation Github, containing rich metadata such as movie titles, genres, casts, crews, descriptions, and user ratings.

## 🔄 Workflow
1. Collect and explore TMDB movie data  
2. Clean and preprocess dataset  
3. Engineer features (genres, cast, crew, overview)  
4. Vectorize text data using TF-IDF  
5. Calculate cosine similarity & correlations  
6. Generate top-N movie recommendations  
7. Streamlit-based deployment for interactive user experience

## 🔍 Sample Output
**Input Movie:** `Inception`  
**Recommended Movies:**  
- Interstellar  
- The Prestige  
- Shutter Island  
- Tenet  
- Memento
