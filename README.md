# Movie_Recommendation
Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning | Collaborative &amp; Content-Based Filtering | Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit

🎬 Movie Recommendation System
--------------------------------
An AI-based Movie Recommendation System built using Python and Machine Learning, designed to suggest movies based on user preferences and viewing history.



🚀 Features

🎯 Personalized recommendations using Content-Based & Collaborative Filtering

🧠 Implemented with Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy

📊 Explored TMDB/IMDB datasets

🌐 Optional Streamlit web app for easy interaction

📈 Model evaluation using similarity metrics like cosine similarity and correlation

🧩 Techniques Used

Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

Feature Engineering (Genres, Cast, Crew)

TF-IDF Vectorization

Cosine Similarity

User-Based Collaborative Filtering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn

🗂️ Dataset

Used TMDB Movie Dataset
 from Kaggle.
It contains metadata like movie titles, genres, cast, crew, overview, and user ratings.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Streamlit (for deployment)

📊 Model Workflow
Data Collection → Cleaning → Feature Engineering → 
Vectorization → Similarity Calculation → Recommendation Generation

💡 Example Output

Input: Inception
Output Recommendations:

Interstellar

The Prestige

Shutter Island

Tenet

Memento

🌍 Deployment

Deployed using Streamlit Cloud / Hugging Face Spaces / Heroku
Example: Live Demo Link
 (if available)

📈 Results

Accuracy of top-N recommendations validated manually

Achieved high content similarity scores

Lightweight and scalable for small to medium datasets

📚 Future Enhancements

Add hybrid recommendation combining both filtering types

Integrate deep learning models (e.g., Autoencoders)

Include user login & rating system

Deploy with real-time data APIs
